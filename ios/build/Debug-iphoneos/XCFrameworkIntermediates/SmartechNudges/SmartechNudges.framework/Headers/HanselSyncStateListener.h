/*!
 
 @abstract
 Protocol to be implemented by the listener for getting callbacks of sync state of Hansel SDK.
 
 @discussion
 You can get the sync state from the hansel sdk by registering a listener with us. Every time the updated values are synced to the SDK, this listener is triggered. You can use this to confirm that a sync has taken place, and run additional tasks you may have after every sync. Implement this protocol and register the listener using setHanselSyncStateListener method of Hansel class.
